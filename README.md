# 🌾 Crop Recommendation and Price Prediction System

A data-driven system that recommends optimal crops based on soil and weather conditions and predicts market prices to help farmers maximize yield and income.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project aims to empower farmers and agricultural planners with intelligent insights by:
- **Recommending the best crops** to cultivate based on soil nutrients, weather conditions, and location.
- **Predicting mandi prices** of crops in advance to help with market planning and decision-making.

The system uses machine learning models trained on diverse datasets including soil parameters, historical crop production, weather, and mandi (market) prices.
